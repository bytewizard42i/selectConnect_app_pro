*This is a submission for the [Midnight Network "Privacy First" Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/midnight-2025-08-20) - Protect That Data prompt*

## What I Built

**SelectConnect** is the first privacy-preserving contact sharing platform that uses zero-knowledge cryptography and economic bonds to enable safe, progressive information sharing while preventing harassment.

SelectConnect solves a $100B privacy crisis where 500M+ professionals share business cards annually, 60% of women face harassment after networking events, and $2.1B is lost to spam from leaked contact data. Our solution combines **progressive contact revelation** with **economic abuse deterrence** to create truly safe networking without compromising privacy.

## Demo

**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/bytewizard42i/SelectConnect](https://github.com/bytewizard42i/SelectConnect)

**Quick Demo Setup**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytewizard42i/SelectConnect.git
cd SelectConnect/selectConnect_app_pro
./start-hackathon-demo.sh
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Screenshots

**Key Features Demonstrated**:
- QR code generation with embedded bond requirements
- Progressive reveal interface (Name → LinkedIn → Email → Phone)
- Real-time bond status and reputation tracking
- Harassment reporting with evidence collection
- Dynamic pricing based on sender reputation

## How I Used Midnight's Technology

SelectConnect leverages Midnight's **Compact v0.16** language to implement **22 ZK circuits** across 967 lines of smart contract code:

### Core ZK Implementations

1. **Private Authorization Circuits**
   - Prove card ownership without revealing admin identity
   - Zero-knowledge credential verification
   - Commitment-based access control

2. **Progressive Disclosure Circuits**
   - Merkle tree proofs for level verification
   - Encrypted reveal with time-limited access
   - Selective information disclosure without full exposure

3. **Economic Security Circuits**
   - Bond commitment and verification
   - Reputation-based pricing calculations
   - Slash mechanism with private evidence

4. **Privacy Routing Circuits**
   - 5-digit anonymous access codes
   - Trackable vs non-trackable interaction modes
   - Cross-context privacy preservation

### Midnight Infrastructure Integration

- **Local Proof Server**: Docker-based Midnight environment for circuit compilation
- **Compact Smart Contracts**: 813 lines implementing unified protocol
- **ZK Proof Generation**: Real-time proof creation for all user interactions
- **Privacy-First Storage**: All sensitive data stored as cryptographic commitments

## Data Protection as a Core Feature

Privacy isn't an afterthought in SelectConnect—it's the foundational architecture. Every design decision prioritizes user privacy:

### Zero-Knowledge by Design
- **Contact Information**: Never stored in plaintext, only as cryptographic commitments
- **User Identity**: Pseudonymous interactions with provable accountability
- **Evidence Storage**: Harassment reports kept off-chain with ZK proofs of validity
- **Access Patterns**: No correlation between real identity and card interactions

### Progressive Privacy Model
1. **Level 0**: Public card exists (no personal data)
2. **Level 1**: Name reveal (encrypted, time-limited)
3. **Level 2**: Professional profile (LinkedIn, encrypted)
4. **Level 3**: Email contact (encrypted, revocable)
5. **Level 4**: Phone number (highest trust, fully encrypted)

### Economic Privacy Protection
- **Abuse Bonds**: Economic deterrent without identity exposure
- **Reputation System**: Track bad actors across contexts without linking to real identity
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Higher costs for repeat offenders while preserving anonymity
- **Victim Compensation**: Automatic payouts from slashed bonds

### Real-World Privacy Guarantees
- **Conference Networking**: Professional connections without harassment risk
- **Dating Safety**: Progressive trust building with economic accountability
- **Enterprise Sales**: Qualified leads without spam or data leaks
- **Cross-Platform**: Privacy preserved across different interaction contexts
